*/One day friends Sally and Harold went to the bagel cafe near their work to grab a snack on their break time. As they were walking along, almost at the bagel cafe, Sally ran into her old school friend Janine. They caught up for a bit and all of a sudden Sally became so hungry she could not help picture Janine as a giant bagel. Sally decided that she and Harold had walked far enough so she smashed Janines knee caps with the baseball bat she had been carrying in her purse (she had it on her for her slow pitch game after work). After Janine went down, Sally got Harold to help her move Janine to the boulevard to free up the sidewalk for the woman in the Jazzy Pride scooter who was wheeling their way. Long story short, Sally saved Harold and herself the long line at the bagel cafe and a total of $5.00 by using Janine as their mid day snack.*/

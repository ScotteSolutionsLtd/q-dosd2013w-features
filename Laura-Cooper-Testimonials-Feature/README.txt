--Testimonials Feature--

Created March 1st, 2013 by Laura Cooper (http://media.laurajcooper.com)

This feature contains a content type of "Testimonial" so that clients/customers can create testimonials, rate their experience, and add their email if they would like a response. They can also add accompanying images if they choose. This content type is geared towards a rental suite, hotel, or other similar service. 

The feature also includes a View, with a page that allows administrators to see all of the testimonials in one location (/admin/testimonials) and can also filter them by published status or rating, and sort them by post date, rating, location, or title. Also included in the View is a block that can be inserted into any page of a site, which displays testimonials with a rating of "Good" or "Excellent" in a slideshow format.

You will need to have the Features module installed and enabled in order to use this feature.
The following modules are necessary to allow the feature to function properly, and are included in the folder:

-Chaos Tool Suite (http://drupal.org/project/ctools)
-Email Field (http://drupal.org/project/email)
-Link (http://drupal.org/project/link)
-Views (http://drupal.org/project/views)
-Views Slideshow (http://drupal.org/project/views_slideshow)


Step 1:
Install and enable all the required modules

Step 2:
Install and enable the "testimonials" module, which can be found under the "Features" section in the modules page

Step 3: 
Add/generate some sample testimonials (or wait until users of the site create some) and then you can view/filter/sort them at <yourdomain.com>/admin/testimonials

Step 4 (optional):
Insert the Testimonials Slideshow Block into a section of the site so that visitors can see a slideshow of the positive testimonials, possibly making them more likely to become customers in the future!

        <p>Features, care of the Features module for Drupal 7. Each folder is a different feature, created by Q College students, learning to use the Drupal 7 Features module and Git. Check the README or .info files in each folder for details about each feature.</p>

<p>Since features aren't exactly merge-able, this is a pool of features created by students at Q College in Victora, BC. <strong>Public contributions are also welcome!</strong></p>

<p>Browse the folders of features on github for one you may like to add to your Drupal 7 website. Each folder has an exactly matched corresponding branch name, and the master branch is empty. So when you clone this repository to your computer, there will be nothing in it but a .git directory.</p>

<p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/ScotteSolutionsLtd/q-dosd2013w-features.git">https://github.com/ScotteSolutionsLtd/q-dosd2013w-features.git</a></p>

<p>This creates a q-dosd2013w-features folder. The folder <em>is</em> repo on your computer. To try out one of the features, checkout the branch of that feature (which is <em>also</em> the folder name):</p>

<p>git checkout my_cool_feature</p>

<p>To see all of the folders, checkout the tag all-features.
git checkout all-features</p>
